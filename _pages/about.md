I am an engineer with a background in Computer Science and experience spanning software, firmware, and interaction technologies. My industry work includes frontend development, augmented reality applications, and over three years in SSD firmware engineering, where I optimized performance and reliability in large-scale products.

My research background in Humanâ€“Computer Interaction, with [publications](https://dl.acm.org/profile/99659314429) at CHI and UIST, gives me a unique perspective on integrating usability into technically complex systems. I thrive on building robust, efficient solutions that deliver both technical excellence and great user experiences.
